# space-invaders-java-GUI

It's the classic Space Invaders arcade game made with Java.

There are a lot of classes but everything is organized neatly, so take a look at the code files found in the src folder.

#### How to Run

Simply extract the contents of SpaceInvaders.zip into the current directory. Then double click on SpaceInvaders.jar to run the game. A menu should appear. Once you start playing, use
the arrow keys to move your ship and space bar to shoot.
